            <p>Pre-historic Boholanos had already a system of writing, but most of the materials used were
                 perishable like leaves and bamboo barks. They had a language similar to that of the other
                  Visayas islands. Bohol’s people are said to be descendants of the last group of inhabitants 
                  of the country called “pintados”, meaning the tattooed ones.1 Before the Spaniards came 
                  in 1521, It is believed that Boholanos had already a culture of their own, as evidenced 
                  by artifacts dug in several areas in Bohol. Excavations in ancient burial grounds on the 
                  mainland have unearthed Tang Dynasty porcelain, Sung and Ming vases and other artifacts of 
                  considerable age, attesting to Bohol’s early contact with travelers/traders from China and 
                  other Southeast Asian civilizations. Cotton and rice constitutes the basis of the interior’s
                   agricultural economy. Local cotton, which was made into a “Lumpot”, was most desired by the
                    Chinese as a material for winter clothing since this has the same quality as wool. Cotton 
                    was critical to the economy in central Visayas for several hundred years prior to the 
                    arrival of the Spaniards, as it formed the basis for lucrative trade item to be bartered 
                    for Chinese porcelains (Echevarria, 1974). During the Spanish regime, two significant 
                    revolts occurred in Bohol. One was the Tamblot Uprising in 1621 led by a native priest 
                    of Babaylan. The other was the Dagohoy Rebellion, considered as the longest uprising 
                    recorded in the annals of Philippine history, led by Fransisco Dagohoy from 1744 lasting 
                    until the year 1829. Bohol was the site of a blood compact, considered in the Philippines 
                    as its first international treaty of friendship with a foreign country, between a local 
                    chieftain and the Spanish Conquistador, Miguel Lopez de Lagazpi in 1565. It was during 
                    this regime that several big stone churches were built which still stand today, attesting 
                    to Bohol’s colonization and Christianization. In 1879, Bohol was composed only of 34 
                    municipalities having a population of 253,103. The Americans, led by Major Henry Hale 
                    of the 44th Infantry Battalion, arrived in Tagbilaran on March 17, 1990. The Japanese 
                    also occupied Bohol several years later during World War II. The American liberation 
                    forces arrived in Bohol on April 11, 1945.</p>
